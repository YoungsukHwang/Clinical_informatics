### [Objective]
This project will build a clinical informatics dashboard, which helps healthcare providers assess patients faster with guided AI predictions. This project uses the datasets originated from or similar to MIMIC-III (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III) data, which has diverse information about the patients admitted to critical care units.

### [Motivation]
Getting a rapid understanding of the context of a patient’s overall health has been particularly important during the COVID-19 pandemic as healthcare workers around the world struggle with hospitals overloaded by patients in critical condition. Intensive Care Units (ICUs) often lack verified medical histories for incoming patients. A patient in distress or a patient who is brought in confused or unresponsive may not be able to provide information about chronic conditions such as heart disease, injuries, or diabetes. Medical records may take days to transfer, especially for a patient from another medical provider or system.

### [Approaches]

#### 1) Diabetes Prediction
Using data from the first 24 hours of intensive care, this project will provide models to determine whether a patient admitted to an ICU has been diagnosed with a particular type of diabetes, Diabetes Mellitus. 

#### 2) Length of Stay Prediction / Mortality Predicition
The length of stay is an important metric both for healthcare providers and patients in that it is an indicator of the severity of illnesses and healthcare resource utilisation. Hospitals also want to improve their intensive care unit statistics by reducing the number of patients dying inside the intensive care unit. This project will provide models that uses data from the first 24 hours of intensive care to predict patient survival and length of stay in ICU.

#### 3) Early Prediction of Sepsis
Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body’s response to infection causes tissue damage, organ failure, or death. In the United States, nearly 1.7 million people develop sepsis and 270,000 people die of sepsis each year; over one third of people who die in U.S. hospitals have sepsis. Early detection and antibiotic treatment of sepsis are critical for improving sepsis outcomes. This project will provide a model that detacts sepsis using patient demographics, vital signs, and laboratory values from ICU clinical data.
